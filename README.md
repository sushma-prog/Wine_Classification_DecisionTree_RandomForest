# 🍷 Wine Classification using Decision Tree & Random Forest

A hands-on machine learning project to classify wine types using **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** algorithms on the **UCI Wine Dataset**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate two powerful classification models — **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** — to predict wine categories based on their chemical attributes.

You will learn:

- Difference between Decision Tree and Random Forest
- When to use ensemble models
- How to visualize feature importance and decision boundaries
- How to evaluate classification models with Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and more

---

## 📦 Dataset Used

- **Dataset Name**: Wine Dataset  
- **Source**: `sklearn.datasets.load_wine()`  
- **Target classes**:
  - 0 = Class_0
  - 1 = Class_1
  - 2 = Class_2  
- **Features**: 13 numerical attributes (alcohol, malic acid, color intensity, etc.)

---

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Performed EDA: histograms, boxplots, and heatmap
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Built and trained:
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier with 100 trees
5. Evaluated both models using:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
6. Plotted:
   - Feature Importances
   - A decision tree from the Random Forest

## 🧠 Model Evaluation

| Model              | Accuracy | Notes                             |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Decision Tree      | ~94.4%   | Simple, interpretable             |
| Random Forest      | 100%     | Powerful ensemble, no overfitting |

✅ Also included:
- Feature Importance Plot  
- Visualized one sample tree from the Random Forest

---

## 📊 Key Visuals

- 📌 Feature Distribution
- 📌 Class-wise Boxplots
- 📌 Correlation Heatmap
- 📌 Decision Tree Diagram
- 📌 Feature Importances

---

## ✅ Final Notes

- Random Forest outperformed Decision Tree by reducing overfitting and increasing accuracy.
- Most important features: `flavanoids`, `color_intensity`, `proline`, `alcohol`.
- Great project to understand ensemble learning and model interpretability.
